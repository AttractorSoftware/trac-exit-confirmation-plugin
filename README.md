trac-exit-confirmation-plugin
=============================
 This plugin allows to prevent trac-user from loosing his text-data on the ticket-page before submitting.

 When creating or modifying ticket user types something in the text-box and closes occasionally
 the browser window. At this moment the confirmation window appears and warns user about unsaved text.
 The user can stay on or leave the current page.
